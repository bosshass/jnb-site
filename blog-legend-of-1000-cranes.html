    <article class="blog-content">
        <a href="blog.html" class="back-link">← Back to all posts</a>

        <p>It was a new day for me. I had left a comfortable, well-paying job in retail to join a tech startup in downtown Denver. I had always dreamed of a 9-5 job, and when I interviewed for this position, something deep inside me just said, "this feels right." I walked into the office full of dreams and hopes, excited that one of my responsibilities included buying beer for the office every Friday. It felt like the fresh start I'd been looking for.</p>

        <p>As the days went on, I learned some unforgettable lessons:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The coffee Czar is never wrong.</li>
            <li>Don't let the coffee pot go empty.</li>
            <li>The more expensive the four-pack, the better the beer must be.</li>
            <li>Keep the animals fed—Mountain Dew and snacks could never run dry.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU ARE OUT OF THINGS TO DO.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Of course, I did just that. One day, I told a beloved mentor of mine, Katie, that I was bored and needed something to do. Katie, being who she is, wasted no time. Minutes later, someone was at my desk asking me to look up instructions on how to fold paper cranes. We ordered origami paper and tools, and I set off to work.</p>

        <p>At the time, I didn't know the deeper meaning behind what I was doing. But today, I do—and I want to share how folding 1,000 paper cranes, which were ultimately never used, became one of the most transformative experiences of my life.</p>

        <p class="highlight-text">In Japanese legend, folding 1,000 paper cranes, known as senbazuru, grants the folder a wish, symbolizing hope, perseverance, and healing.</p>

        <p>To sit and methodically fold crane after crane demands patience, focus, and faith—qualities I didn't realize I was developing at the time. But as each crane took shape, so did my confidence, my determination, and my vision for the future.</p>

        <p>Day after day, I folded. It wasn't glamorous work, but it became a form of meditation—an exercise in discipline and dedication. I needed that patience and perseverance to grow both personally and professionally within the company. Folding those cranes wasn't about busywork; it was about preparing myself for bigger challenges, unknowingly building the very foundation that would carry me forward.</p>

        <p>The legend promises that after folding 1,000 cranes, you are granted a wish. And I had one: <strong>to one day own my own company, to grow and prosper in a career that brought me joy, and to build a life filled with purpose and passion.</strong></p>

        <p>That wish didn't come true overnight. But the lessons I learned through each careful fold stayed with me. They helped me succeed in that tech startup, pushing me to take on more responsibility, lead with intention, and dream bigger. And when the time came to step out on my own, to create JNB LLC, it was that same patience, focus, and perseverance that carried me through.</p>

        <p>Folding 1,000 cranes wasn't just an office task—it was a symbol of resilience and the quiet, steady work it takes to turn dreams into reality.</p>

        <p>So, here's to the cranes, the legends that inspire us, and the belief that even the smallest steps can lead to something extraordinary.</p>

        <p>And yes, I still make sure the coffee pot never runs dry.</p>
