Resource Utilization & Cost Calculator (J&B LLC)

Amazing detail — I turned your whole spiel into a clean, editable calculator that matches the way you think about the business.
It lets you plug in any resource (salary or hourly), bakes in overhead per hour, shows idle cost, lost revenue, margin, and
runs the “what if we billed 10/20/30/40 hours” scenarios. It also includes the JR/Austin drive-time example.

What’s inside (tabs)

- ReadMe — quick instructions + formulas.
- Inputs — enter your monthly operating costs and target gross margin.
- Resources — one row per person:
  - You fill: Type (Salaried/Hourly), Paid Hours/Week, Annual All-in (if salaried) or Hourly Cost, Billable Rate, Billed Hours/Week.
  - It calculates: Weekly cost, cost/hr, overhead/hr (auto from Inputs), utilization, revenue, idle hours, idle labor cost, weekly profit, margin, rate floor at current utilization.
  - Also shows: Potential revenue at 100% utilization and revenue lost from idle time.

- Scenarios — pick a resource name and see the money at 10/20/30/40 billed hours (revenue, profit, margin).
- Team Summary — totals across the roster: paid vs billed hours, team utilization, revenue, weekly cost (labor + OH), profit, margin, potential revenue @100%, and lost revenue.
- JR Example — exactly your case: paid 8h/day, billed 5.5h, $125/hr. It shows daily revenue, cost, profit, and margin. Change any number to see the impact.

How this answers your goals

- Show underutilization in $$: “Revenue Lost from Idle” (per person and team) + “Idle Labor Cost”.
- Include overhead correctly: Overhead/hr is computed from your monthly operating costs and total paid hours, then added to each person’s cost per hour.
- Price reality, not hope: “Rate Floor @ Current Utilization” tells you the minimum rate to hit your target margin given how many hours you actually bill.
- Salaried vs hourly: Salaried uses annual all-in / 52; hourly multiplies by paid hours — either way you get cost/hr that includes taxes/benefits.
- What if they billed +10 more hours?: Use Scenarios (or just change “Billed Hours/Week” on Resources) to watch revenue, profit, and margin jump.
- 100% utilization view: See potential revenue and profit at full deployment (per person + team).
- “You earned 66k but it cost 64k”: Enter the data and the Team Summary will surface that instantly, plus what profit would be at proper utilization.
