            <p>In classic distance horse racing, a pacesetter doesn't break from the gate carefully.</p>

            <p>They go.</p>

            <p>They push the tempo early so the race can't drift into something slow and tactical. Because a slow race is dangerous. It favors the horse that waits, saves everything, and sprints late.</p>

            <p>So the pacesetter makes it honest.</p>

            <p>They stretch the field. They force movement. They prevent complacency.</p>

            <p>Sometimes they're entered to protect a stronger stablemate — a horse with deeper stamina and a better finish. The pacesetter burns energy so the contender doesn't have to.</p>

            <p>By the final stretch, they often fade.</p>

            <p>And occasionally — if no one challenges them — they win anyway.</p>

            <h2>The Business Version</h2>

            <p>For most of my career, I've been the one who goes early.</p>

            <p>I set the tempo before anyone else is comfortable. I push standards before they're popular. I tighten margins before they become emergencies.</p>

            <p>Because I've seen what happens when a business drifts.</p>

            <p>A slow business doesn't collapse overnight. It erodes quietly.</p>

            <p>Margins blur. Owners compensate with effort instead of structure. Leaders absorb pressure instead of distributing it. Chaos becomes "normal."</p>

            <p>So I move fast.</p>

            <p>I implement systems before people ask for them. I confront numbers before they become stories. I force clarity early — because I know the cost of waiting.</p>

            <p>And yes — sometimes I burn too much fuel doing it.</p>

            <p>Sometimes being the one who breaks first means you're the one who feels the headwind.</p>

            <h2>Pete</h2>

            <p>In high school, my teacher Pete talked about pace differently.</p>

            <p>Not about forcing the field. About finishing the race.</p>

            <p>He ran the Bolder Boulder into his seventies. Steady. Disciplined. Never dramatic.</p>

            <p>He didn't preach intensity. He preached distribution.</p>

            <p>He said:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Run smart enough that you still have something left to finish.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>At seventeen, I thought that sounded conservative.</p>

            <p>At thirty-something, running businesses, raising kids, carrying weight that doesn't show up on a P&amp;L — I understand it differently.</p>

            <h2>The Shift</h2>

            <p>Four months ago, I wouldn't have questioned the front-running approach.</p>

            <p><em>If you don't set the pace, someone else will. If you don't control tempo, the market will. If you don't force honesty, the numbers eventually will.</em></p>

            <p>But here's what racing quietly teaches you:</p>

            <p><strong>The pacesetter doesn't always run the whole distance.</strong></p>

            <p>And if they try to, they don't last long.</p>

            <p>This week, I told my clients something I wouldn't have said a year ago:</p>

            <p><strong>I don't have to carry the early pace alone.</strong></p>

            <p>Strong businesses aren't built on one person breaking into the wind every mile.</p>

            <p>They're built on structure. On shared load. On systems that hold tempo even when the founder steps back.</p>

            <p>And nothing broke.</p>

            <p>The work moved forward. The rhythm adjusted. The business held.</p>

            <p>Because sustainable leadership isn't about dominating the start.</p>

            <p><strong>It's about building a pace that survives you.</strong></p>

            <p>Pete didn't last because he was intense.</p>

            <p>He lasted because he was measured.</p>

            <p>There's a difference between forcing the tempo and engineering one.</p>

            <p><strong>I'm learning which one scales.</strong></p>
