            <p>In classic distance horse racing, a pacesetter doesn't break from the gate carefully.</p>

            <p>They go.</p>

            <p>They push the tempo early so the race can't drift into something slow and tactical. Because a slow race is dangerous. It favors the horse that waits, saves everything, and sprints late.</p>

            <p>So the pacesetter makes it honest.</p>

            <p>They stretch the field. They force movement. They prevent complacency.</p>

            <p>Sometimes they're entered to protect a stronger stablemate — a horse with deeper stamina and a better finish. The pacesetter burns energy so the contender doesn't have to.</p>

            <p>By the final stretch, the pacesetter often fades.</p>

            <p>And occasionally — if no one challenges them — they win anyway.</p>

            <h2>The Business Version</h2>

            <p>For most of my career, I've been the one who goes early.</p>

            <p>I set the tempo. I raise the standard. If something feels loose, I tighten it. If something feels unclear, I push for clarity.</p>

            <p>Because a slow business is dangerous.</p>

            <p>It hides inefficiency. It disguises weak margins. It lets people conserve energy in all the wrong places.</p>

            <p>So I made things move.</p>

            <p>And sometimes, I burned too much fuel doing it.</p>

            <h2>Pete</h2>

            <p>In high school, my teacher Pete talked about pace differently.</p>

            <p>Not about forcing the field. About finishing the race.</p>

            <p>He ran the Bolder Boulder into his seventies. Steady. Disciplined. Never dramatic.</p>

            <p>He didn't teach "as fast and hard as you can."</p>

            <p>He said:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Run smart enough that you still have something left to finish.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Shift</h2>

            <p>Four months ago, I wouldn't have questioned the front-running approach.</p>

            <p><em>If you don't set the pace, someone else will.</em></p>

            <p>But here's what racing quietly teaches you:</p>

            <p><strong>The pacesetter doesn't always run the whole distance.</strong></p>

            <p>The one who finishes well knows how to conserve. Knows when to draft. Knows when to release power.</p>

            <p>This week, I told my clients something I wouldn't have said a year ago:</p>

            <p><strong>I don't have to burn early every mile to lead well.</strong></p>

            <p>And nothing broke.</p>

            <p>The work moved forward. The rhythm adjusted. The business held.</p>

            <p>Because sustainable leadership isn't about dominating the start.</p>

            <p><strong>It's about building a pace you can live inside.</strong></p>
