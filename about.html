                    <h3>I'm Sara.</h3>
                    <p>I run JNB LLC from Littleton, Colorado — but my team and clients span the globe.</p>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Nobody picked me for this role. I built it</span> — one messy cleanup, one hard conversation, one business owner who finally understood their own numbers.</p>
                    <p>I started as a receptionist at a tech startup. I barely passed accounting in school. Now I help business owners who feel the same way about numbers that I used to — intimidated, frustrated, or just confused.</p>
                    <p>The difference? I speak human first, numbers second.</p>

            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <p>We're not here to audit your decisions or make you feel bad about what you didn't know. We're here to help you see what's actually happening in your business — and figure out what to do about it.</p>
            
            <p>Most clients come to us with a "books problem" and discover it goes a lot deeper. Balanced books don't tell you if your business is healthy — they just tell you the math checks out. One client thought she was doing fine because her books were clean. She was also bleeding $4,000 a month in unbilled time and had no idea.</p>
            
            <p>Bookkeeping tells you what happened. We show you why it happened — and what to do next.</p>
            
            <h2>What We Believe</h2>
            <p><strong>Friendly. Bold. Minimalist. Tech-Savvy. Human.</strong></p>
            <p>That's not a tagline — it's who we are. We don't believe professionalism means perfection. It means showing up with clarity, consistency, and care. It means talking like real people, solving real problems, and never hiding behind jargon.</p>
            <p>In a world full of automated everything, people still crave connection. That's why we build systems that are teachable, not complicated. Reports that make sense, not noise. And we talk to clients like partners, not projects.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Because behind every transaction is a person — and behind every business is a story.</p>

            <h2>Lifeline: Your Business at a Glance</h2>
