                    <h3>I'm Sara.</h3>
                    <p>I built JNB LLC around one principle: <strong>financial clarity should change how you run your business</strong> &mdash; not just satisfy compliance.</p>
                    <p>I've worked directly inside growing businesses &mdash; cleaning up messy books, restructuring reporting, and helping owners finally understand what their numbers were actually saying.</p>
                    <p>What I saw over and over again wasn't incompetence. It was noise.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <h2>What Changes When You Work With Us</h2>
            <p>First, the noise settles.</p>
            <p>Your books get clean. Your reports make sense. Your taxes stop feeling like a looming threat.</p>
            <p>But more importantly &mdash; you start to see clearly.</p>
            <p>You understand where money is going. You recognize patterns. You see pressure points before they become problems.</p>
            <p>That shift is powerful. Because clarity doesn't just improve your numbers. It changes how you feel running your business.</p>
            
            <h2>What We Deliver</h2>
            <p>Not just reconciled accounts. Not just filed returns.</p>
            <p>You get consistent monthly reporting, in-house business tax preparation, clear communication, financial visibility that makes sense, and strategic insight when you're ready for it.</p>
            <p>If something is simple, we keep it simple. If something requires deeper strategy, we structure it properly.</p>
            <p>No chaos. No ego. No guessing.</p>
            
            <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
            <p>Business owners who care. The ones who think about payroll before they fall asleep. Who worry about hiring too soon &mdash; or too late. Who want to grow, but don't want chaos to come with it.</p>
            <p>You don't need hype. You don't need pressure. You need clarity.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Clients Stay</h2>
            <p>Because clarity compounds.</p>
            <p>When your bookkeeping is stable and taxes are predictable, you stop operating in reaction mode. When your financial strategy is intentional, decisions feel lighter. When your systems are structured, time frees up.</p>
            <p>This is not about "doing accounting." It's about reducing friction inside your business.</p>
            
            <h2>How We Grow With You</h2>
            <p>Most clients start with bookkeeping and tax support. As things stabilize, the questions get bigger.</p>
            <p><em>Can we hire? Are we pricing correctly? Why does growth feel heavier than it should?</em></p>
            <p>That's where fractional CFO work comes in. And when systems start straining, we build structure there too.</p>
            <p>Everything builds in layers. Nothing is forced. You decide how deep we go.</p>
            
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>Not dependence. Not complexity. Control.</p>
            <p>When your numbers are clear, your decisions get lighter. When your structure is stable, your time opens up.</p>
            <p>That's the outcome.</p>
